title : "Things I learnt in 2020"
---

As Forrest Gump's mama said,  
>‘Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.'

But nobody knew the year 2020 would open a Pandora box for us. There were lockdowns which derailed economies. But to some lucky ones like me, it gave a lot of free time and I was too bored, so I tried everything. Here are the things which I learned this year :
1. **Cooking** : From only knowing to make tea to preparing lip-smacking paneer butter masala on Diwali, is a giant leap for me(maybe a small step for mankind). I was living in a rented flat in March. Lockdown forced me to learn cooking. With free time and youtube tutorials what cannot be learned.
2. **Concept of once a week exercise** : I read Body by Science by Dr. Doug Macduff and John Little. It changed my view point regarding strength training. I found the exercise program described in the book beneficial and it fits with my priorities. 
3. **Kernel development** : I started learning about OS development from [MIT 6.828: Operating System Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/schedule.html). It is the most difficult thing I have ever done this year. It was fun and frustrating at the same time. Doing it alone without much lecture material made it more difficult. I could only complete it half but it exposed me to so much new material. Looking back I am still proud of all the [homework and lab work](https://github.com/Eikansh/jos) I did for the course.
9. **Note making technique called Zettelkasten** : It is a ever-growing personal Wikipedia of your knowledge on postcard size papers. It can also be implemented digitally. I am still unsure whether to have a digital or physical zettelkasten. You can know about it more [here](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).
4. **Chess** : I knew the basics of chess but it took covid to get past it. I started by learning from the books Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess and Winning chess by Irving Chernev and Fred Reinfeld. I only solved tactical puzzles on [lichess](https://lichess.org/). and have a rating of 2033 in it. I still don't play full games due to time constraints and have low rating of 1346 in classical.
2. **Home management** : Surviving lockdown in a flat has made me a perfect house wife err... husband material. I now know the price of vegetables, can manage groceries, cleaning, etc. This year I transitioned into adulthood way faster than I had imagine.
6. **Podcasts** : This year I discovered some great podcasts while continued listening to my favorites Radiolab, Planet Money and The Knowledge Project. I highly recommend [Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed) by John Green. Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Dorian Yates and David Sinclair appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast changed my viewpoint regarding health and nutrition. 
7. **Books** : My top 5 books I read this year - 
- Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari
- Body by Science by John Little, Doug McGuff
- Discovery of India by Jawaharlal Nehru
- One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez
- The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn by Richard Hamming
8. **Health** : Having learned about nutrition and health I have become more conscious what goes inside my body. Inspired by Rhonda Patrick on Joe Rogan's podcast I have started taking Vitamin D3 and omega 3 supplements. It's been only a month and it may take time to get the results. I have also started following a basic skin care routine. 
10. **Online articles** : These are the articles which I loved reading and thinking about.
- [This is water](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/) 
- [You and your research](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html)
- [Dilbert's career advice](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html)
- [Looking back : what was important](https://alternative-democracy-research.org/2020/04/20/what-was-important/)
- [No moving parts](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25078/25078-h/25078-h.htm)

Apart from it I also learned some random facts like ["Snakes are allergic to milk"](https://www.firstpost.com/india/nag-panchami-not-just-about-snake-worship-but-subjecting-the-object-of-veneration-to-needless-agony-death-3268816.html/) and realized some obvious things like "Everybody gonna die".  

Seeing the world reeling under covid19 made me realized how vulnerable and resilient human civilization is at the same time . I am grateful to make to the year end with sound health. I am hopeful of the coming year, looking forward to make some new friends and keep my curiosity alive by following the mantra "Stay hungry, Stay foolish."
