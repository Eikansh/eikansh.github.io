Internet is truly making this world a global village. In the past 30 years, it has changed how information flows. In the next 30 years, it will change how our society functions. It has become a world of its own and we have become its citizen. Social media are the panchayats of this new world.  

Social media influencers are the new leaders of social media. They have begun to figure out how this shit works. Until others figure it out, they are going to influence the world. They may not be the eligible people to have influence. But in human history, when did we had the right person in the right position. It's always been who can understand the game and play it well.  

The internet can make a personal brand more prominent than the person itself. We can leverage the scalability of the internet to our advantage. I will not be shocked if people start taking pseudo identities which will be passed on when they die.  

Internet is helping find everyone a niche. Previously it was not possible to be a fisherman in a village of woodcutters. With millions of people on the internet, it is easy to find a few thousand who are into what you love.  

The speed which with news travels on the internet is astounding. A Greek messenger has to die to carry the message from the battle of Marathon to Athens. Now the information travels faster than the truth itself. Memes have become a new way of spreading propaganda.  

We still haven't evolved to process the fast pace of development that is happening. Our brain is not wired to maintain more than 150 relationships. The number 150 is called the Dunbar number. Internet is a great tool. The challenge for us is not to let it become our master.
