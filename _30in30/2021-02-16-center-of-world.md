Living in our head makes us self obsessed. We become so engrossed in our world that we forget the world of others. It becomes difficult to understand others viewpoint.  

We all have seen movies. In the film, the hero may randomly bump into a stranger while going to meet his lover. We all see ourselves as the hero. But in the real world, we can also be that stranger. We can be an extra in somebody else's movie. We should be ok with it. The world doesn't revolve around us. The sooner we internalise it, the sooner we will have a peace of mind.  

Imagine we are going in a car and someone overtakes us almost causing a collision. Our first thought will be of anger and frustration towards the stupidity of the driver. But there is a chance that we were in his way. He may be going to meet his dying father and we are blocking his path. The thing is we don't know and our first reaction is to think from our viewpoint.  

There is a quote, 
>We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behaviour.

The one reason for this is it is difficult to understand other intentions. The other reason is we give ourselves more importance. If we take one step in the right direction, the world can be a better place to live.
