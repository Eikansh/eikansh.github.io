Magic is one of the oldest art forms. For example, cups and balls date back to ancient Egypt. Magicians use sleight of hand, misdirections to achieve effects which looks impossible. After a trick ends, the audience keeps wondering how it is performed. Knowing how a trick is done can ruin the effect for the audience.  

Magic tricks, especially the sleight of hand tricks in their core, are built upon simple ideas. What makes them look magical is years of practice. As Bruce Lee said, 
> I fear not the man who has practised 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practised one kick 10,000 times.

Magicians too work on a trick for long. But instead of kicking on our butt, they want to entertain us. It requires so much work, planning and practice to make a simple idea look magical. Life is also built upon simple things which need to be practised many times.  
 
Presentation matters  

The magicians can't successfully pull off a trick without a strong stage presence. Similarly, in life if you can't present your work well, it becomes harder to convince others. Even if the ideas are good, you need to communicate them well.  

Magic is the art form which relies on the surprise factor of the audience. The performer mixes the magic with humour and does a trick which surprises everyone.
