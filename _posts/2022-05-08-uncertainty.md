*Transcript of the speech given at Toastmasters club.  
Purpose: To introduce myself*

Good evening fellow toastmasters and guests. 

15 years ago when I visited bangalore on a family trip, I didn't know I would be giving a speech here. 

My name is Eikansh and I am from Uttar Pradesh. I have been riding my luck since, July 8, 1996, the year I was born. I have a sister two years younger to me. My father passed away when I was 5 years old. For most of the years, my mother was a homemaker and my grandmother was the main breadwinner of the family. She was a government health worker. My family ensured that my sister and I had a good childhood. We used to go on family trips during summer holidays. Me and my sister studied in a convent school. 

After completing my class 10th I had to choose an optional subject. My options were biology, economics and c++. Biology and economics sounded too tough. I opted for c++. Everything was logical. I loved it once I started studying it and didn't have to memorize much.

In class 12, I got malaria, typhoid and jaundice at the same time. Guys, I wouldn't recommend it. 0.5 stars out of 5 for the experience. While on bed rest instead of studying physics, chemistry or maths, I completed the whole c++ syllabus. It is reflected in my grades too. With 97 out of 100, I was the highest scorer in c++ in my school. 

While joining Btech I had to again face a choice of which stream to join. Most of the streams had physics in them. In Mechanical and civil engineering we had to study mechanics and thermodynamics. In electrical engineering, we have to study electromagnetic laws, and magnetism. I wanted to join a stream which does not have physics. For all the physics lovers here, sorry I don't like physics. I don't get it. I still don't know why the monkey is pulling the pulley and why I have to calculate the force. So I chose computer science at jss academy of technical education in Noida. 

In college, I did only the things which interested me without worrying about grades. Or at least this is the reason I give for my not so good marks. In the 3rd year of my college, I decided to give the gate exam. For everyone who doesn't know what gate is, it is like IIT jee but for doing mtech who couldn't go to iits in their bachelors.

I had my gate exam in 2 months. I still remember the day like it was yesterday. The date was Dec 2, 2018. I got a call from my mother that my grandmother has passed away. I was in shock. I talked to her 2 days ago. Everything was fine. How could she die so abruptly? After her passing, our family was like a circus without its ringmaster. 

Well, I scored badly on the exam. 
My relatives suggested that I get a job. And all I wanted was another chance. I took a year drop to again prepare for gate. Our savings and government pension kept us financially secure. I and my sister were a support system for each other. I attempted the exam once again in 2020 and got an all India rank of 118. I got into the Indian Institute of Science. The wallpaper that was on my laptop for more than 2 years had become a reality.

Due to covid, the college admissions got delayed. I started learning to cook in my free time. A guy who could barely toast bread can now make Kadhai paneer. I also read many books. I created a blog on which I post rarely. Once college started, time flew on a whim. 

I had a lot of fun in college. I made many new friends, went on trips, explored Bangalore through food and clubs and also studied a lot. I started playing badminton and carrom. In the college sports meet my team won gold in carrom.

I will be graduating in less than 2 months. 
I have been placed in Wells Fargo. I also have an off-campus offer from Qualcomm. The job will start a new phase in my life. I will be financially independent and start supporting my family. I am looking forward to what life has to offer me now.
