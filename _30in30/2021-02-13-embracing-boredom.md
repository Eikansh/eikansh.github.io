In this fast-moving world of technology, entertainment is at our fingertips. It should be improbable that we are ever bored. Yet we all know the reality. We all sometimes feel disinterested in everything while mindlessly scrolling through our Instagram or Twitter feed.  

Our attention span is getting reduced to 10 seconds of TikTok video. The mind jumps from one stimulus to others without taking rest. These stimuli can be in the form of a youtube video, an Instagram post or tweets. It's high time that we start embracing boredom.  

Things have to be in balance. Our parents have to get creative to get over the eery feeling of boredom. Now we have so much stimulus that we have to slow things down. With the abundance of information, if we manage ourselves, we can get benefit from the internet. 

 The first step to counter boredom is to minimize the consumption of social media and news. Our mind gets overwhelmed with all the happenings of the world. For some time, you will have a craving to check them. So the next step is to engage yourself in some task. The task can be as simple as walking or listening to music.  

We can also get bored while working on things that are either too difficult or too simple for our skills. We enjoy doing challenge which matches our skills. This is called the flow state. Breakdown the task according to your skill level. If you still get bored, switch to another task.  

When we are working on something boredom is inevitable. We get creative insights when we are bored. Trying to combat boredom using our smartphone is not a real solution. It just differs the situation to some other time which then becomes more difficult to manage.
