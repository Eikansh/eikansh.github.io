The movie has a recurring theme of how poor accepts their fate and don't even try to escape their rooster coop. The film is one of the filmmaker attempts trying to escape the rooster coop called the Indian cinema.  

The movie is based on the Man Booker price winner book by Arvind Adiga. It is director by Ramin Bahrani. The main cast consists of Adarsh gourav, Rajkumar Rao and Priyanka Chopra.  

Through its witty dialogue, crisp screenplay and impeccable performance make the film a delight to watch. Adarsh Gourav as Balram halwai has done justice to the role. His acting depicts the transition from a naive village boy to an entrepreneur who can go to any means to achieve success. Rajkumar Rao as Ashok and Vijay Maurya as mongoose fits their role.  

Through the journey of Balram, the film takes us on the journey of India. It is the story of an underclass breaking free from the slave mentality.When Balram was a child, he was called the White tiger; a rare breed because of his intelligence. He has to fight the circumstances and take some questionable decisions to achieve his ambitions.  

Balram is an underdog for whom we all are vouching for. It tests our moral compass when we still support him even when he uses unfair means to achieve his goals. We experience New Delhi through the eyes of Balram. From dingy rooms below the dazzling multistory buildings to the internal tussle of a poor.  

Overall, the movie is worth watching. The gripping storyline and tensed music keep you fixed to your seat.
