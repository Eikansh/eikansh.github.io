These articles are part of a 30-day challenge in which I wrote one post a day. The main motive of this challenge was to keep my idea machine running and improve my writing skills. As Ernest Hemingway said, 
>The first draft of anything is shit.

Here you are looking at a collection of first drafts making it a pile of shit. The articles are poorly thought, hastily written and lousily edited. You are welcome to read them. I will be happy to know and correct my flaws.
