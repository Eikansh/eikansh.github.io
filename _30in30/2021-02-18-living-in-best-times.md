In our entire history of humankind, this is the best time to live in. All the scientific and technological advancements have taken us leaps and bounds forward. We are living a life which the kings and nobles couldn't afford in the past. Be it entertainment, fashion, or the food we are being spoiled by the excess of choices.  

This is the longest period in history without a major war. The economy is running fine. Life expectancy is at an all-time high. Science and technology are developing at a rapid pace. We have become so used to it that a slight dip produces a great disappointment. The news articles start pouring. The news sells sensation. If we know everything is fine nobody will read or watch the news.  

It is human nature to get used to the current state and be dissatisfied with it. We have become comfortable on our bed of roses that we are counting the thorns. We complain about 15 min delay in food delivery, an hour of a power cut, and the list goes on. The dissatisfaction is needed to make progress. But we shouldn't be disappointed all the time. We need to appreciate the life we are living.  

Comparing with other pandemics, Covid-19 is the least effective. We have broken our record of producing the fastest vaccine. Previously, the record was of 4 years for the mumps vaccine. The covid-19 vaccine has taken less than one year to develop and deploy. Sadly, many of us lost our family members or job due to covid.  

We complain about small things forgetting the bigger picture. In the comfort of our life, we neglect to appreciate it. A little gratitude towards life can take us a long way.
