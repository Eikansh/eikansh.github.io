The world we live in is designed by the choices made by others. Every object that we interact with is present because of someone's effort. The choices they made in creating it now affects us all.   

The world we live in is run by the hard work of others. Think of all the work it requires to bring food to our table. Or how we take things like amazon one-day delivery for granted. It takes a collective effort from people to keep society running.  

The world we live in makes progress due to the inventions made by others. Scientists and researchers work round the clock to get a single breakthrough. The technological advancements have helped us to live in the comfort that we are in.   

The world we live in is livable due to the kindness of others. Many of us go through a lot in life. Without kindness and empathy in us, society would just be driven to madness.   

We get used to the smoothness with which the society is running. From time to time, it's good to remind us that it takes blood and sweat of many to keep society's wheels moving forward.  

So, work hard because you don't know who you are affecting. Also, be kind to everyone. It is the simplest way we can contribute to society.
