Hi, I am Eikansh. I love computers, and I am passionate to learn about them. Currently, I am an M.Tech. student at the Department of [Computer Science and Automation(CSA)](https://csa.iisc.ac.in) in the [Indian Institute of Science(IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in). I have completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science from [JSS Academy of Technical Education](https://jssaten.ac.in/), Noida. 

Apart from computers, I try to read from a variety of fields in my spare time. You can find my book notes and summaries on this website. I also enjoy listening to podcasts and music, cooking, strength training, and anything that catches my attention.
